          Since the early days of the found-footage subgenre, the movies have
          tried to pass themselves off as true pieces of footage. This attempt
          to present genuine footage has proven effective in the horror genre.
          Horror has become synonymous with the tagline, “Based on true events,”
          and found-footage movies go one step further in aiming to maintain
          realism to maximize the scares. These movies have been popular with
          audiences for over twenty years, and have been particularly appealing
          for the immersive elements the subgenre offers. A clear link can be
          established between the found-footage combination of a raw, often
          rough style and the rise in popularity of true crime stories – in the
          last thirty years, interest in true crime has grown rapidly with
          documentaries, podcasts, and books becoming immensely popular.

          For Zúñiga, the Golden Biznaga is sure to help further propel “Sister
          & Sister,” an autobiographical story about two teenage sisters who
          travel from Costa Rica to Panama in search of their absent father.
          Also making waves at the Malaga Festival, which runs March 10-19, was

          The following contains spoilers for Episode 8 of Daisy Jones and The
          Six.With only two episodes left of Daisy Jones and The Six, the series
          adaptation of the novel of the same name, the story and band drama of
          a legendary level have somewhat veered off the path paved by the book
          by Taylor Jenkins Reid when it comes to what has unfolded so far. With
          the tension building to a more obvious, romantic/hateful breaking
          point between faces of the band Daisy (Riley Keough) and Billy (Sam
          Claflin) to Karen (Suki Waterhouse) making the first move on Graham
          (Will Harrison) over jealousy, the episodes have found a way to make
          the lead-up to the dreaded night in which the band breaks up feel much
          more anxiety-inducing, despite the audience already knowing what is
          about to happen.
